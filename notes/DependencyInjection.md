Some thingds such as Controllers, ViewComponents, and TagHelpers are not resolved by the container by default but instead by factories.
However this can be changed:

this question is about something else but it shows a cool technique if you nned to inejct something for use in a static extension method
thoug some would frown at the use of servicelocator pattern

Since there will be built in dependency injection in aspnet vnext I think we will use that instead of ninject

in vnext/aspnet 5 owin there is startup code like this:
 // Configure is called after ConfigureServices is called.
        public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IHostingEnvironment env, ILoggerFactory loggerfactory)
        {
            // Configure the HTTP request pipeline.
            // Add the console logger.
            loggerfactory.AddConsole();

maybe we will be able to plugin log4net or other logger there?
