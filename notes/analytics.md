## Tracking Users

You must make sure you have the full rights to use this service, to upload data, and to use it with your Google Analytics account.
You will give your end users proper notice about the implementations and features of Google Analytics you use (e.g. notice about what data you will collect via Google Analytics, and whether this data can be connected to other data you have about the end user). You will either get consent from your end users, or provide them with the opportunity to opt-out from the implementations and features you use.
You will not upload any data that allows Google to personally identify an individual (such as certain names, social security numbers, email addresses, or any similar data), or data that permanently identifies a particular device (such as a mobile phoneâ€™s unique device identifier if such an identifier cannot be reset).
If you upload any data that allows Google to personally identify an individual, your Google Analytics account can be terminated, and you may lose your Google Analytics data.
You will only session stitch authenticated and unauthenticated sessions of your end users if your end users have given consent to such stitch, or if such merger is allowed under applicable laws and regulations.

PII Viewer for Google Analytics is a Google Chrome extension which allows you to map the user ID stored in Google Analytics to locally stored personally identifiable information (PII) such as name and email address.

## Tracking code notes

utm_source: Identify the advertiser, site, publication, etc. that is sending traffic to your property, for example: google, newsletter4, billboard.

utm_medium: The advertising or marketing medium, for example: cpc, banner, email newsletter.
most common: 
    referral = link from a website
	organic = organic search no advertisement boost
	none - directly typed url
	not set - no parameter

utm_campaign: The individual campaign name, slogan, promo code, etc. for a product.

utm_term: Identify paid search keywords. If you're manually tagging paid keyword campaigns, you should also use utm_term to specify the keyword.

utm_content: Used to differentiate similar content, or links within the same ad. For example, if you have two call-to-action links within the same email message, you can use utm_content and set different values for each so you can tell which version is more effective.

## Dimensions and Metrics

Dimensions are attributes of your data. For example, the dimension City indicates the city, for example, "Paris" or "New York", from which a session originates. The dimension Page indicates the URL of a page that is viewed.

Metrics are quantitative measurements. The metric Sessions is the total number of sessions. The metric Pages/Session is the average number of pages viewed per session.

## Tracking Ecommerce

https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/analyticsjs/ecommerce

ga('require', 'ecommerce');

Adding a Transaction

Once the plugin has been loaded, it creates a transparent shopping cart object. You can add transaction and item data to the shopping cart, and once fully configured, you send all the data at once.

You add transaction data to the shopping cart using the ecommerce:addTransaction command:

ga('ecommerce:addTransaction', {
  'id': '1234',                     // Transaction ID. Required.
  'affiliation': 'Acme Clothing',   // Affiliation or store name.
  'revenue': '11.99',               // Grand Total.
  'shipping': '5',                  // Shipping.
  'tax': '1.29'                     // Tax.
});

Adding Items

Next, to add items to the shopping cart, you use the ecommerce:addItem command:

ga('ecommerce:addItem', {
  'id': '1234',                     // Transaction ID. Required.
  'name': 'Fluffy Pink Bunnies',    // Product name. Required.
  'sku': 'DD23444',                 // SKU/code.
  'category': 'Party Toys',         // Category or variation.
  'price': '11.99',                 // Unit price.
  'quantity': '1'                   // Quantity.
});

Sending Data

Finally, once you have configured all your ecommerce data in the shopping cart, you send the data to Google Analytics using the ecommerce:send command:

ga('ecommerce:send');

This command will go through each transaction and item in the shopping cart and send the respective data to Google Analytics. Once complete, the shopping cart is cleared and ready to send data for a new transaction. If a previous ecommerce:send command was issued, only new transaction and item data will be sent.

Note: While most implementations will send both transaction and item data, you can send transactions without items, and items without transactions. If you send an item hit without a transaction, a transaction hit with only the ID will be sent automatically.
