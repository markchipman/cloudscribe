http://stackoverflow.com/questions/31237613/how-to-register-a-global-filter-with-mvc-6-asp-net-5

2014-11-15 it seems premature to try to build cloudscribe on vnext mainly because certain dependencies are not available yet
such as log4net, mysql.data etc. supposedly you can use that if you target the desktop framework instead of core but it seems not to work.
I can add a reference to MySql.Data via NuGet but it gives a build error the type or namespace cannot be found as if the reference was not there.

So, we will wait and make the needed changes soon after the final release of vnext aka aspnet 5, or until the needed dependencies are available.

from my review of aspnet vnext cloud optimized core, the things that will change will be:

the vs project files and solution structure
new project.json files for projects instead of .csproj
new wwwroot folder for web projects and only static files like js and css go below there, no code lives under there, files there are handled by static file handler only which is good security policy

no more global.asax - still supported in the full framework but not in the core cloud optimized framework
no more App_Start folder with partial startup classes, Startup.cs in the project root has everything for app configuration, depency injection via ConfigureServices
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/24998796/shouldnt-owinstartupattribute-run-before-global-asax-and-application-start
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/20168978/do-i-need-a-global-asax-cs-file-at-all-if-im-using-an-owin-startup-cs-class-and

new VS integration client side utilities Bower and npm (to add client side libraries)
http://bower.io/

https://www.npmjs.org/ node packaged modules sort of like client side nuget

http://gruntjs.com/
http://gruntjs.com/getting-started

The package.json file belongs in the root directory of your project, next to the gruntfile.js, and should be committed with your project source. Running npm install in the same folder as a package.json file will install the correct version of each dependency listed therein.

unification of routing for mvc and web api
only difference is for api there is no action just http verbs get, post, put,delete
http://blogs.msdn.com/b/webdev/archive/2014/11/24/content-negotiation-in-mvc-5-or-how-can-i-just-write-json.aspx

app.UseMvc(routes =>
{
    routes.MapRoute(
        name: "default",
        template: "{controller}/{action}/{id?}",
        defaults: new { controller = "Home", action = "Index" });

    // Uncomment the following line to add a route for porting Web API 2 controllers.
    // routes.MapWebApiRoute("DefaultApi", "api/{controller}/{id?}");
});

Razor view engine now has TagHelpers
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Za89_-I25AI
which gives more control over markup in the view as compared to htmlhelpers like EditorFor and DropdownListFor
http://www.hanselman.com/blog/ASPNET5VNextWorkInProgressExploringTagHelpers.aspx

new concept of ViewComponents meant to replace child actions concept

new built in dependency injection which we will use instead of ninject
// This method gets called by the runtime.
public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
    // Add EF services to the services container.
    services.AddEntityFramework(Configuration)
        .AddSqlServer()
        .AddDbContext<ApplicationDbContext>();

    // Add Identity services to the services container.
    services.AddDefaultIdentity<ApplicationDbContext, ApplicationUser, IdentityRole>(Configuration);

    // Add MVC services to the services container.
    services.AddMvc();

    // Uncomment the following line to add Web API servcies which makes it easier to port Web API 2 controllers.
    // You need to add Microsoft.AspNet.Mvc.WebApiCompatShim package to project.json
    // services.AddWebApiConventions();

}

new configuration system, the old System.Configuration is still there but not sure it may be desktop framework only
we will have to re-write some code perhaps but, the new lighter system seems very flexible
you can have it look for multiple files and the last one has the top priority so
we should be able to do similar kind of things as we did with appSettings in user.config in mojoportal
new config classes can use json or xml

# Unsupported things currently for dnxcore50

System.Configuration 
we have to do away with ProviderBase and Provider Model


MvcSiteMapProvider - they plan to support but have not yet started any work, no-one on the project has time currently they say

none of the other db drivers works yet on dnxcore, just ms sql (supposedly also sqlite but it has errors for me)
these should eventually be available

System.Data.SqlServerCe

DbProviderFactory seems to be not expected for use since it was not implemented in
Microsoft.Data.Sqlite
