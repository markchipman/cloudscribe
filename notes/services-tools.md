"A command is an imperative instruction to do something. We expect only one receiver of a command because it is point-to-point"
"An event is an indicator to interested parties that 'something has happened'. We expect zero to many receivers as it is one-to-many communication i.e. publish-subscribe
An event is usually fire-and-forget, because we do not know it is received."
