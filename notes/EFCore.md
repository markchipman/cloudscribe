Query types
An EF Core model can now include query types. Unlike entity types, query types do not have keys defined on them and cannot be inserted, deleted or updated (i.e. they are read-only), but they can be returned directly by queries. Some of the usage scenarios for query types are:
Mapping to views without primary keys
Mapping to tables without primary keys
Mapping to queries defined in the model
Serving as the return type for FromSql() queries

about default values
https://github.com/aspnet/EntityFramework/issues/7089

In my efforts to update cloudscribe to EFCore 2.0 I learned something that I did not know before. If you use default values in the db (ie defined in OnModelCreating) as of EFCore2.0 there are warnings shown when generating migrations and also in logging. For example:
The 'bool' property 'AllowNewRegistration' on entity type 'SiteSettings' is configured with a database-generated default. This default will always be used when the property has the value 'false', since this is the CLR default for the 'bool' type. Consider using the nullable 'bool?' type instead so that the default will only be used when the property value is 'null'. The above warning only affects inserts not updates.

So in general, you should avoid using db defaults and just use default values on the entity. But, if you need to add new bool properties and you need existing rows to get true, the solution is use a db default of true, generate the migration with the new properties, then remove the default value and generate another migration. Now existing rows will get true from the first migration but the default value will be removed by the second migration. The default value on the entity itself will be used for inserts.
The behavior was the same in EFCore 1.x, but in 2.x the warning was added bringing to light that I was doing it wrong by using db defaults.

Timestamp/row version
A timestamp is a property where a new value is generated by the database every time a row is inserted or updated. The property is also treated as a concurrency token. This ensures you will get an exception if anyone else has modified a row that you are trying to update since you queried for the data.
How this is achieved is up to the database provider being used. For SQL Server, timestamp is usually used on a byte[] property, which will be setup as a ROWVERSION column in the database.

The above seems problematic if I want to be able to support multiple database platforms.
Can I use the same model for all dbs?
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/33970569/best-way-to-handle-optimistic-concurrency-with-entity-framework-7

By using optimistic locking you only detect the concurrency problem.

http://www.asp.net/mvc/overview/getting-started/getting-started-with-ef-using-mvc/handling-concurrency-with-the-entity-framework-in-an-asp-net-mvc-application

A concurrency conflict occurs when one user displays an entity's data in order to edit it, and then another user updates the same entity's data before the first user's change is written to the database. If you don't enable the detection of such conflicts, whoever updates the database last overwrites the other user's changes. In many applications, this risk is acceptable: if there are few users, or few updates, or if isn't really critical if some changes are overwritten, the cost of programming for concurrency might outweigh the benefit. In that case, you don't have to configure the application to handle concurrency conflicts.

John clicks Save first and sees his change when the browser returns to the Index page, then Jane clicks Save. What happens next is determined by how you handle concurrency conflicts. Some of the options include the following:

You can keep track of which property a user has modified and update only the corresponding columns in the database. In the example scenario, no data would be lost, because different properties were updated by the two users. The next time someone browses the English department, they'll see both John's and Jane's changes ï¿½ a start date of 8/8/2013 and a budget of Zero dollars.

This method of updating can reduce the number of conflicts that could result in data loss, but it can't avoid data loss if competing changes are made to the same property of an entity. Whether the Entity Framework works this way depends on how you implement your update code. It's often not practical in a web application, because it can require that you maintain large amounts of state in order to keep track of all original property values for an entity as well as new values. Maintaining large amounts of state can affect application performance because it either requires server resources or must be included in the web page itself (for example, in hidden fields) or in a cookie.

You can let Jane's change overwrite John's change. The next time someone browses the English department, they'll see 8/8/2013 and the restored $350,000.00 value. This is called a Client Wins or Last in Wins scenario. (All values from the client take precedence over what's in the data store.) As noted in the introduction to this section, if you don't do any coding for concurrency handling, this will happen automatically.

You can prevent Jane's change from being updated in the database. Typically, you would display an error message, show her the current state of the data, and allow her to reapply her changes if she still wants to make them. This is called a Store Wins scenario. (The data-store values take precedence over the values submitted by the client.) You'll implement the Store Wins scenario in this tutorial. This method ensures that no changes are overwritten without a user being alerted to what's happening.

Find() - when you want to get an item by primary key. This will return null if it can't find an item. It will look in the context before going to the database (as pointed out by Yaron in the comments) which can be an important efficiency factor if you need to get the same entity multiple times while the same context is alive.

Single() - when you expect exactly one item to be returned by a query. This will throw an exception if the query does not return exactly one item.

SingleOrDefault() - when you expect zero or one items to be returned by a query (i.e. you are not sure if an item with a given key exists). This will throw an exception if the query does not return zero or one items.

First() - when you expect one or more items to be returned by a query but you only want to access the first item in your code (ordering could be important in the query here). This will throw an exception if the query does not return at least one item.

FirstOrDefault() - when you expect zero or more items to be returned by a query but you only want to access the first item in your code (i.e. you are not sure if an item with a given key exists)
